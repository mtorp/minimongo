Quickfind protocol allows sending information about which rows are already present locally to minimize 
network traffic.

Protocal has 3 phases:

encodeRequest: Done on client. Summarize which rows are already present locally by sharding and then hashing _id:_rev|
encodeResponse: Done on server. Given complete server list and results of encodeRequest, create list of changes, sharded by first two characters of _id
decodeResponse: Done on client. Given encoded response and local list, recreate complete list from server.

Interaction of sort, limit and fields:

- fields present: _rev might be missing. Do not use quickfind
- limit with no sort: This gives unstable results. Do not use quickfind
- sort: final rows need to be re-sorted. Since fields not present, is possible.
- no sort, no limit: always sort by _id
